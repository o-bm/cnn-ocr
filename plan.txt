Data Generation

synthesis data generation
generation of MRZ strings done. data/generate.py
generator can be factored into class for better modularity and reusability
antoher class to convert generated -> mrz
apply transformations to image to be more realistic (noise..)
python has mrz library, can be used to check if the MRZ is valid


convert generated MRZ strings to image with OCR-B font
apply transformations to image to be more realistic (noise..)
take a batch of ~100k? images and split into train, val, test sets
take a baseline comparison with easyocr and tesseract

Training & Validation
